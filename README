Jose Vieitez Final Project, Mario Kart

Draws Mario kart world, Driving Car and course. 

I spent a good amount of time making a beautiful world in photoshop, including a ceiling/ sky that looked real, but realized the sky is nearly invisible with the camera settings I created that avoid going “underground.” You can see it, though, by pressing “f.”

Left to do:

Draw kart. Human-controlled motion (I may just go with an automatic path to avoid dealing with collisions, but have to weigh which is more efficient). More objects on the road. Shadows if I can apply what we learn this week.
