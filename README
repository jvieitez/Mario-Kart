Jose Vieitez Final Project, Mario Kart

Jose Vieitez
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2014

Draws Mario kart world, Driving Car and course. 

I spent a good amount of time making a beautiful world in photoshop, including a ceiling/ sky that looked real, but realized the sky is nearly invisible with the camera settings I created which prevent the camera from going “underground.” You can see it, though, by moving the camera around with the are keys.
I spent a good deal of time creating collision detection between the kart and walls/ crates. So feel free to drive around and crash into things!
